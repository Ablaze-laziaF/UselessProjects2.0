# Supposed to be "Mr. Bin" is a "Mr What's This" now  üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Ablaze


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Faizal Hussain - College of Engineering Adoor

### Project Description
It was intended to be a Dustbin that runs away when you get near it. In the remaining last 30 minutes, it became a something that was supposed to move "hands" when you pass by it. By the end, it became something that literally made me wonder "WHAT IS this?". 
 must say, nothing ever came out so useless as this useless project üòâ. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Dustbins weren't getting the right justice. Anyone approached them only to throw waste papers or something into them. They also needed a chance, so I decided to give them one. (Atleast, tried)

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution was simple. give them legs to run when someone approaches them. And so, I tried, but I don't know what became of the supposedly walking legs.
